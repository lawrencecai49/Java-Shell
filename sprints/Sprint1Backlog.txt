//Sprint 1 Backlog.  
October 21 to October 27

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I should have a shell where I can input instructions to interact with the file system  
b) As a user, I should be continually prompted for input by the shell
c) As a user, my input should be interpreted correctly regardless of any whitespaces
d) As a user, I should be able to terminate the shell program
e) As a user, I should be able to store and navigate through files and directories
g) As a user, I should be able to view all or a specified number of my most recent inputs. It should be
listed such that the largest number is the most recent inputl) As a user, I should be able to see full pathname of the current working directory
m) As a user, I should be able to save and track my pathway movements as I change the current working directory so that I can move back to my previous locations
